## Assignment 1 - PyTorch / Collab and MNIST

In this assignment you will practice working with the Google Colab environment and PyTorch. Youâ€™ll also practice setting a simple image classification pipeline. The goals of this practice are the following:

- Gain experience setting and using notebooks on Google Colab.
- Develop familiarity with basic structures of PyTorch: tensors, autograd, modules.
- Practice dealing with image data.
- Understand better the data-driven approach.
- Practice setting a image classification pipeline.
- Train a neural network as a image classifier.
- Understand the train/test/val data split, and learn how to evaluate and adjust your system.
- Use visualization tools to evaluate your work.
